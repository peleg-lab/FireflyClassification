This folder contains code for classifying firefly sequence data using signal processing methods: dynamic time warping, Jaccard similarity index, dot product, and SVM in 3-dimensional signal parameter space.

The Jupyter notebooks contain code for replicating the results of the paper and plotting the corresponding ROC curves and confusion matrices. The notebooks can be run as-is, while the .py files contain functions for performing classification using either literature-based or data-driven population references. Dynamic time warping using population references is performed in Matlab for faster computation time using dtw_popref.m
